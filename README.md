## Overview

This project explores traffic congestion across major areas in Bangalore, focusing on **capacity utilization, traffic volume, compliance behavior, and environmental factors**.  
The goal is to move beyond assumptions and identify what *actually* drives congestion.

---

## Business Problem

Urban congestion is often blamed on traffic volume, weather, or signal discipline.  
This project aims to:

- Identify the most and least congested areas
- Compare congestion against road capacity utilization
- Test common assumptions about congestion causes
- Highlight structural and infrastructural bottlenecks
- Support long-term, data-backed policy thinking

---

## Dataset

- Source: Simulated Bangalore traffic dataset
- Format: CSV
- Granularity: Area-level traffic observations
- Key fields include:
  - Area name
  - Traffic volume
  - Congestion level
  - Road capacity utilization
  - Signal compliance
  - Weather conditions

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL**  
  - Filtering, aggregation, ranking
  - Deriving city-level benchmarks

- **Power BI**  
  - Interactive dashboards
  - Scatter, bar, and ranking visuals
  - Reference lines and comparisons

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

Key preparation steps included:

- Removing incomplete or invalid traffic records
- Standardizing area and road names
- Validating congestion and capacity utilization ranges
- Converting data types and resolving inconsistencies
- Creating derived measures such as:
  - Average Congestion
  - Average Traffic Volume
  - Average Capacity Utilization
  - City-wide baseline metrics

---

## Analysis & Key Insights

- Congestion varies significantly across areas
- High traffic volume alone does **not** guarantee high congestion
- Signal compliance improves order but not throughput
- Weather impact on congestion is minimal
- Structural capacity and area design play a dominant role

## Dashboard

### 📊 Page 1 — City Congestion Overview

![City Congestion Overview](Images/dashboard_page1.png)

This page provides a city-level snapshot, highlighting:

- Average congestion benchmarks
- Area-wise congestion ranking
- Deviation from city average
- Relationship between congestion and road capacity

---

### 🔍 Page 2 — Root Cause Analysis (Myth vs Reality)

![Root Cause Analysis](Images/dashboard_page2.png)

This page challenges common assumptions by analyzing:

- Traffic volume vs congestion
- Signal compliance vs congestion
- Weather impact on congestion

**Key takeaway:**  
Congestion in Bangalore is driven more by **structural capacity constraints** than by short-term operational factors.

---

## Policy & Infrastructure Implications

- Expanding road capacity without redesign may offer limited relief
- Area-level planning matters more than volume control alone
- Signal discipline improves safety, not throughput
- Long-term congestion reduction requires:
  - Capacity alignment
  - Smarter road design
  - Area-specific infrastructure planning
